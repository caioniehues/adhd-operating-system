# ADHD Operating System - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The ADHD Operating System is a comprehensive digital productivity platform designed specifically for individuals with ADHD. It integrates task management, time awareness, focus enhancement, and knowledge organization into a unified system that adapts to the unique cognitive patterns and needs of ADHD users.

## Problem Statement

People with ADHD face unique challenges in traditional productivity systems:
- **Executive Dysfunction**: Difficulty initiating, organizing, and completing tasks
- **Time Blindness**: Poor perception of time passing and estimation of task duration
- **Working Memory Issues**: Forgetting important information and losing context
- **Hyperfocus Management**: Difficulty switching between tasks or stopping when hyperfocused
- **Overwhelm**: Traditional systems often present too much information at once
- **Motivation Challenges**: Need for immediate feedback and dopamine-driven engagement

Current productivity tools are designed for neurotypical users and often exacerbate these challenges rather than addressing them.
