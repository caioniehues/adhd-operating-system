# Generate Task Master agent usage analytics

Analyze how Task Master sub agents are being used and provide insights for workflow optimization.

## Analytics Process

1. Gather usage patterns (simulated for now):
   - Which agents are invoked most
   - Common agent chains
   - Task completion rates with agents
   - Time saved using agents

2. Analyze workflow efficiency:
   - Average task completion time
   - Agent automation success rate
   - Manual vs automated task updates
   - Context preservation effectiveness

3. Generate insights and recommendations

## Report Format

```
📈 Task Master Agent Analytics
==============================

Usage Statistics:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Agent               | Uses | Success Rate
--------------------|------|-------------
task-navigator      | 45   | 98%
task-implementer    | 32   | 95%
task-analyzer       | 18   | 100%

Workflow Patterns:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Most Common: navigator → implementer → status update
2. Complex Tasks: analyzer → navigator → implementer
3. Planning: analyzer → expansion → navigator

Efficiency Metrics:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Tasks with agents: 40% faster completion
- Context switches: 60% reduction
- Forgotten updates: 90% reduction
- Dependency conflicts: 100% caught

Recommendations:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Continue using task-analyzer for complexity >5
✅ Increase task-navigator use for context switches
⚠️  Consider task-implementer for all coding tasks
💡 Try chaining: analyzer → implementer → tester

Agent Performance:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🏆 Most Valuable: task-implementer (time saved)
🚀 Most Efficient: task-analyzer (issue prevention)
📈 Most Used: task-navigator (daily workflow)
```

## Insights for Optimization

Based on analytics, consider:

1. **Automation Opportunities**
   - Auto-invoke navigator at session start
   - Chain analyzer → implementer for complex tasks
   - Schedule daily analyzer runs

2. **Workflow Improvements**
   - Use agents for all task status updates
   - Implement agent-first development
   - Create custom agent chains

3. **Team Benefits**
   - Share successful agent patterns
   - Document agent best practices
   - Create team-specific agents
