# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop intelligent task management system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Build ADHD-specific task system with automatic breakdown, visual prioritization, dependency tracking, and shame-free deferral
# Details:
1. Create ADHD task data model:
   - Estimated time with ADHD buffer (+40%)
   - Energy level required (low/medium/high)
   - Interest score (1-5)
   - Complexity score
   - Procrastination tracking
2. Implement auto-breakdown for tasks >2 hours
3. Build visual priority matrix (Urgency vs Interest)
4. Create dependency visualization graph
5. Implement "Quick Wins" dopamine section
6. Add task aging indicators
7. Build one-click shame-free deferral
8. Create smart task suggestions based on energy

# Test Strategy:
Test task creation and auto-breakdown. Verify priority calculations. Test deferral without data loss. Validate dependency chains.
