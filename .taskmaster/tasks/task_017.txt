# Task ID: 17
# Title: Build secure sync and backup system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create robust synchronization and backup infrastructure with encryption, versioning, and multi-device support
# Details:
1. Implement sync engine:
   - Real-time sync protocol
   - Conflict resolution algorithms
   - Delta sync for efficiency
   - Multi-device support
   - Offline queue management
2. Build backup system:
   - Automated daily backups
   - Version history (30 days)
   - Point-in-time recovery
   - Export to standard formats
3. Add security features:
   - End-to-end encryption option
   - Zero-knowledge architecture
   - Secure key management
   - Privacy controls
4. Create sync UI:
   - Sync status indicators
   - Conflict resolution interface
   - Backup management
5. Performance optimization

# Test Strategy:
Test sync reliability across devices. Verify encryption. Test backup/restore. Validate conflict resolution.
