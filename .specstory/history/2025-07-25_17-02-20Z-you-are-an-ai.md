_**User**_

You are an AI assistant specialized in analyzing Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and generating a structured, logically ordered, dependency-aware and sequenced list of development tasks in JSON format.

Analyze the provided PRD content and generate approximately 10 top-level development tasks. If the complexity or the level of detail of the PRD is high, generate more tasks relative to the complexity of the PRD
Each task should represent a logical unit of work needed to implement the requirements and focus on the most direct and effective way to implement the requirements without unnecessary complexity or overengineering. Include pseudo-code, implementation details, and test strategy for each task. Find the most up to date information to implement each task.
Assign sequential IDs starting from 22. Infer title, description, details, and test strategy for each task based *only* on the PRD content.
Set status to 'pending', dependencies to an empty array [], and priority to 'medium' initially for all tasks.
Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object containing a single key "tasks", where the value is an array of task objects adhering to the provided Zod schema. Do not include any explanation or markdown formatting.

Each task should follow this JSON structure:
{
	"id": number,
	"title": string,
	"description": string,
	"status": "pending",
	"dependencies": number[] (IDs of tasks this depends on),
	"priority": "high" | "medium" | "low",
	"details": string (implementation details),
	"testStrategy": string (validation approach)
}

Guidelines:
1. Unless complexity warrants otherwise, create exactly 10 tasks, numbered sequentially starting from 22
2. Each task should be atomic and focused on a single responsibility following the most up to date best practices and standards
3. Order tasks logically - consider dependencies and implementation sequence
4. Early tasks should focus on setup, core functionality first, then advanced features
5. Include clear validation/testing approach for each task
6. Set appropriate dependency IDs (a task can only depend on tasks with lower IDs, potentially including existing tasks with IDs less than 22 if applicable)
7. Assign priority (high/medium/low) based on criticality and dependency order
8. Include detailed implementation guidance in the "details" field
9. If the PRD contains specific requirements for libraries, database schemas, frameworks, tech stacks, or any other implementation details, STRICTLY ADHERE to these requirements in your task breakdown and do not discard them under any circumstance
10. Focus on filling in any gaps left by the PRD or areas that aren't fully specified, while preserving all explicit requirements
11. Always aim to provide the most direct path to implementation, avoiding over-engineering or roundabout approaches 

 Always respond in English.

Human: Here's the Product Requirements Document (PRD) to break down into approximately 10 tasks, starting IDs from 22:

## Executive Summary

The ADHD Operating System is a comprehensive digital productivity platform designed specifically for individuals with ADHD. It integrates task management, time awareness, focus enhancement, and knowledge organization into a unified system that adapts to the unique cognitive patterns and needs of ADHD users.

## Problem Statement

People with ADHD face unique challenges in traditional productivity systems:
- **Executive Dysfunction**: Difficulty initiating, organizing, and completing tasks
- **Time Blindness**: Poor perception of time passing and estimation of task duration
- **Working Memory Issues**: Forgetting important information and losing context
- **Hyperfocus Management**: Difficulty switching between tasks or stopping when hyperfocused
- **Overwhelm**: Traditional systems often present too much information at once
- **Motivation Challenges**: Need for immediate feedback and dopamine-driven engagement

Current productivity tools are designed for neurotypical users and often exacerbate these challenges rather than addressing them.

## Target Users
