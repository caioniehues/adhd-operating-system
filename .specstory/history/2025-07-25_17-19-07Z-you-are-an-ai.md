_**User**_

You are an AI assistant specialized in analyzing Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and generating a structured, logically ordered, dependency-aware and sequenced list of development tasks in JSON format.

Analyze the provided PRD content and generate approximately 5 top-level development tasks. If the complexity or the level of detail of the PRD is high, generate more tasks relative to the complexity of the PRD
Each task should represent a logical unit of work needed to implement the requirements and focus on the most direct and effective way to implement the requirements without unnecessary complexity or overengineering. Include pseudo-code, implementation details, and test strategy for each task. Find the most up to date information to implement each task.
Assign sequential IDs starting from 22. Infer title, description, details, and test strategy for each task based *only* on the PRD content.
Set status to 'pending', dependencies to an empty array [], and priority to 'medium' initially for all tasks.
Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object containing a single key "tasks", where the value is an array of task objects adhering to the provided Zod schema. Do not include any explanation or markdown formatting.

Each task should follow this JSON structure:
{
	"id": number,
	"title": string,
	"description": string,
	"status": "pending",
	"dependencies": number[] (IDs of tasks this depends on),
	"priority": "high" | "medium" | "low",
	"details": string (implementation details),
	"testStrategy": string (validation approach)
}

Guidelines:
1. Unless complexity warrants otherwise, create exactly 5 tasks, numbered sequentially starting from 22
2. Each task should be atomic and focused on a single responsibility following the most up to date best practices and standards
3. Order tasks logically - consider dependencies and implementation sequence
4. Early tasks should focus on setup, core functionality first, then advanced features
5. Include clear validation/testing approach for each task
6. Set appropriate dependency IDs (a task can only depend on tasks with lower IDs, potentially including existing tasks with IDs less than 22 if applicable)
7. Assign priority (high/medium/low) based on criticality and dependency order
8. Include detailed implementation guidance in the "details" field
9. If the PRD contains specific requirements for libraries, database schemas, frameworks, tech stacks, or any other implementation details, STRICTLY ADHERE to these requirements in your task breakdown and do not discard them under any circumstance
10. Focus on filling in any gaps left by the PRD or areas that aren't fully specified, while preserving all explicit requirements
11. Always aim to provide the most direct path to implementation, avoiding over-engineering or roundabout approaches 

 Always respond in English.

Human: Here's the Product Requirements Document (PRD) to break down into approximately 5 tasks, starting IDs from 22:

<context>
# Overview  
[Provide a high-level overview of your product here. Explain what problem it solves, who it's for, and why it's valuable.]

# Core Features  
[List and describe the main features of your product. For each feature, include:
- What it does
- Why it's important
- How it works at a high level]

# User Experience  
[Describe the user journey and experience. Include:
- User personas
- Key user flows
- UI/UX considerations]
</context>
<PRD>
# Technical Architecture  
[Outline the technical implementation details:
- System components
- Data models
- APIs and integrations
- Infrastructure requirements]

# Development Roadmap  
[Break down the development process into phases:
- MVP requirements
- Future enhancements
- Do not think about timelines whatsoever -- all that matters is scope and detailing exactly what needs to be build in each phase so it can later be cut up into tasks]

# Logical Dependency Chain
[Define the logical order of development:
- Which features need to be built first (foundation)
- Getting as quickly as possible to something usable/visible front end that works
- Properly pacing and scoping each feature so it is atomic but can also be built upon and improved as development approaches]

# Risks and Mitigations  
[Identify potential risks and how they'll be addressed:
- Technical challenges
- Figuring out the MVP that we can build upon
- Resource constraints]

# Appendix  
[Include any additional information:
- Research findings
- Technical specifications]
</PRD>
